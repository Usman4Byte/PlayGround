# Developer Playground 🧪

Welcome to my experimental sandbox!

This repository serves as a dedicated testing environment for exploring the limits of Git and GitHub features. I use this space to ensure my main projects remain clean and production-ready.

### 🚀 What happens here?

You might observe some chaotic activity in this repository. Here is what I am testing:

* **Git Workflows:** Testing complex commit histories, squashing, and rebasing.
* **GitHub Actions:** Debugging CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows.
* **Feature Exploration:** Rapidly opening and closing issues/PRs to test templates and automation rules.
* **Collaboration:** Testing co-authored commits and code review policies.

### 🛠 Tech Stack Experiments

Occasionally, I drop snippets here to test logic before implementing them in larger applications:
- Python / JavaScript scripts
- Bash automation
- API integrations
